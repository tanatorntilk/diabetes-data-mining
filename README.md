# 1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder, is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It poses a substantial global health burden, with its prevalence steadily rising. Understanding the importance of diabetes mellitus extends beyond its immediate health implications. It is a significant risk factor for various complications, including cardiovascular diseases, kidney disease, and vision loss. While there is no cure for diabetes, strategies like losing weight, eating healthily, being active, and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the harms of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment,
the findings may contribute to the broader efforts aimed at reducing the burden of diabetes and improving public health outcomes.

### Objective of Research

In light of the increasing prevalence and associated health risks, this research aims to contribute to the early detection of diabetes mellitus. The primary objectives are twofold:

1. **Identification of Factors for Early Detection:** Investigate and identify key factors that could serve as early indicators of diabetes mellitus. This is to use for prediction of whether individual has diabetes.

2. **Association Between Important Factors:** Examine the associations between the identified factors. Understanding how these factors interact can provide insights into the complex dynamics of diabetes development.
